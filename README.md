## About Me

Hi there, my name is AyÅŸe KonuÅŸ.

I'm a graduate of Yildiz Technical University with a bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering. My academic journey seamlessly integrates these fields, providing me with a strong foundation in applied math, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and software development â€“ all areas that align with my personal interests.

I work in the Avionic Software and Ground Systems team within the Light Platforms unit at Baykar Technology. I am a Full-Stack C# .NET software developer, specializing in developing human-machine interactive, end-user-focused ground control station software systems. I am responsible for the operational control interfaces (OCI) of unmanned aerial vehicles developed by the Light Platforms unit.

I work on object-oriented software and am open to learning and development. I am someone who enjoys quick responses and getting the job done. Since my profession is also my hobby, I never lose my sense of curiosity, enthusiasm, and determination.
